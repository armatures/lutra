            I have developed application front ends using Angular, Angular 2, Elm, BackboneJS, React and Ember.
             I have also rendered things to a page in production applications using Ruby/Rails/ERB,
             or Razor and ASP.NET, but when people talk about the front-end in 2017, I assume we're talking
             about Javascript frontends for the most part. I prefer Elm (with React coming in second) because
             of its compile-time assurance of correctness, elegant type system, and time-traveling debugging.
             It is much more pleasant than raw Javascript (or typescript), but I understand most shops are not
             sold on it yet. If not Elm, I prefer React, because its unidirectional data flow makes for more
             maintainable applications.

            I prefer Git. Git is powerful, simple, and flexible. I've also used TFS and Perforce,
             each of which seems less powerful and less simple from my experience of ~9 months with each of them.
             I've done feature branches and pull requests for larger teams, or just pushed things to master on
             smaller teams. I've worked on teams ranging from 1 pair of developers to upwards of 20 developers
             working across different countries, and smaller teams obviously don't need to bother with the same
             processes that larger teams have.
